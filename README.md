# finances
An application to categorize and reconcile transactions from Mint, track bills, and budget where some accounts have shared responsibility.  The application is designed to run locally on a desktop computer.  Transaction history, bill payments, and budget targets are viewed in a web browser.  Reconciliation is done in the command line terminal used to initialize the application - this is intentional.  I wanted a faster interface with quick keyboard interaction for reconciliation.  Mint 'integration' is done via selenium automation of a browser that downloads a CSV of transactions.

This app pulls the front end from a separate project, which I currently track separately and build only locally.
